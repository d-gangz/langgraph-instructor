"""
Basic streaming example that demonstrates real-time structured data extraction.

Input data sources: User prompt asking for person profile extraction
Output destinations: Console output with streaming JSON responses
Dependencies: OpenAI API key, instructor, openai, pydantic packages
Key exports: Address, Person models for structured extraction
Side effects: Makes OpenAI API calls, prints streaming output to console
